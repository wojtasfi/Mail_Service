Almost every project- big or small- needs some service for sending different emails to its clients. Logging confirmation, newsletter, new events, promotions, actions needed- these are only few examples of notifications send every day. Instead of creating new service one will be able to quickly startup Mail Service, add all customized tamplates with React based UI and start dispatching requests for sending emais- using REST API or asynchronously with Kafka. Additionally admin user will be able to search already sent emails using dates or full text search.
